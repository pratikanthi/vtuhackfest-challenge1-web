# vtuhackfest-challenge1-web

For the admin of TalentSpear/ VTU Hackfest reading this:

1. This is a repository of the 1st weekly challenge ( category : WEB)
2. I've refrained from using any CSS frameworks ( ex: Twitter - Bootstrap ), only a little jQuery is used.
3. To populate the table data, I'm using json file which makes up for a more real-world compatible way of doing things.
4. Please click on the validate button to see the form validation part.
